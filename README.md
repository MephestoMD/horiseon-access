# Horiseon Accessibility Project
*Optimizing an application for accessibility*

## Goal

To transform a visually complete web application into one which appears identical at the surface, but through the use of semantic elements and code consolidation, is easier to use for both visually impaired end-users and for future developers looking to improve upon this application.

## Purpose

Semantic elements make a web application easier to work with, both for the visually impaired and for future developers who may need to dive into the code in order to update content. For the visually impaired speifically, screen readers in use today require semantic elements in the HTML they analyze in order to properly convey the structure of the application to the end-user. Without these semantic elements, the user may find the webpage inaccessible.

## Method

While visually appealing, the webpage in its initial form lacked semantic HTML elements, opting to use 'div' elements in many places where &ltsection&gt, 'header', 'article', etc., would be more suitable to provide better semantic structure. These 'div' elements were replaced with aforementioned semantic elements where appropriate. In addition, much of the CSS styling contained redundant code which, when condensed, allows for future developers to more easily update their content.
